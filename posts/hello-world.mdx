Hey there, world! Welcome to my digital playground! I'm <strong>Victor Bicudo</strong>, a <strong>Front-end Developer</strong> who loves bringing ideas to life.

My coding adventure began way back when I was a curious teenager, completely blown away by the awesomeness of technology. When I was 18 years old, my cousin Cristian showed me some websites he was creating with HTML and CSS, and I instantly fell in love with the subject. However, I never really considered it as a professional career at the time, so I studied a bit and then moved on.

But life has a funny way of bringing us back to our true passions. At the age of 24, feeling lost and unsure of what to do with my life, I stumbled upon the application process for FATEC, a college in Santos/SP that had just opened. I decided to give it a shot, and to my delight, I was accepted! And here I am now, with 7 years of experience as a <strong>Front-End Developer</strong>.

Throughout my journey, I've had the opportunity to work on some amazing projects and collaborate with incredibly talented teams. These experiences have not only expanded my repertoire, but also taken my technical abilities to new heights. My portfolio is a window into my creative universe, showcasing my latest projects and the hurdles I've conquered throughout my career. Every line of code and every pixel I've polished is a testament to my dedication to creating exceptional digital experiences.

But this website isn't just about showcasing my work—it's a platform to share my passion and knowledge with you. I firmly believe that technology's real value lies in its power to make a positive impact on people's lives. That's why I'll also be dishing out stories, insights, and handy tips on how to unleash the magic of programming to create innovative solutions and inspire other creative minds.

So whether you're an aspiring developer, a potential client itching for some digital wizardry, or just a tech enthusiast looking for some inspiration, I'm absolutely stoked to have you here. Take a tour of my portfolio, dive into my articles, and join me on this extraordinary adventure.

Thanks for swinging by, and I hope you leave feeling inspired to explore the boundless possibilities of the digital realm!

With heaps of enthusiasm, Bicudo :)
